# Program Description
# This program will compute the molecular weight of a carbohydrate
# in grams per mole based on the number of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen atoms in the molecule
#
#
# Algorithm (pseudocode)
# print what program is about
# number of hydrogen
# number of carbon
# number of oxygen
# print answer

    H = eval(input("What is your Hydrogen value?"))
    C = eval(input("What is your Carbohydrates value?"))
    O = eval(input("What is your oxygen valye?"))
    print(H, C, O)
